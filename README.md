## Features

### Current Features
* #### Navagation Bar
![Navigation Bar](assets/readmepics/nav.png)
    * The bar consists of 4 tabs which navigate to different sections of the page. This can help users easily find the section they find most useful.

* #### The landing image
![Landing image](assets/readmepics/landing.png)
    * The background image displaying a man boxing and contains overlapping text showing the name of the club as well as a quote. This makes the name clear and adds a design thats pleasing to the eye

  
* #### About Us section
![About us](assets/readmepics/about.png)
    * This section summarises what we offer and who is in charge of the sessions by following two lists. It doesnt overload the users brain with information wnd uses simple language being accessible to people with a language barrier.

* #### Memberships section
![Memberships](assets/readmepics/member.png)
    * To keep consistency for the user, the design for this section maintains the same styles as the previous section. Hopefully, this keeps the attention of the user as the content should be simple and fast to follow.

* #### Schedules section
![Schedule](assets/readmepics/schedule.png)
    * Displays 2 boxes which seperate the information of the sessions. The location of the places where the sessions take place are in the back-ground offering more detail and context. All information needed to attend the sessions are listed over the images.


* #### Sign Up section
![Sign Up](assets/readmepics/sign.png)
    * Form that requires first and last names to be filled out as well as an email. If part of the form is not filled a message will pop up notifying the user which helps prevent mistakes upon sign up.

* #### Footer
![Footer](assets/readmepics/footer.png)
    * Contains icons that act as links to the social media. This leaves a simple and intuitive design. 
  
### Feature ideas to implement
* Purchasing on the site
* A public chatroom for members to talk within
* A rate and review section

### General testing
* I used the site on my Iphone and i sent the website to friends who used a Samsung to see if there were any unpredicted changes
* The site was refreshed and checked after each Git Commit

### Bugs
#### Known, Unfixed Bugs
* No known bugs that have not been fixed after testing

#### Fixed Bugs
* Users were able to submit the form without filling in all of the details. I fixed this by adding the required attribute to the end of each input element.
* The navigation bar would not change from its default color. I fixed this by targetting the list elements which were descendants of the div surrounding the text rather targetting the entire div element.

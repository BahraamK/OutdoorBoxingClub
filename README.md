# Outdoor Boxing Club

Outdoor Boxing Club is a site that hopes to encourage people (living in London, England) to get into a fun outdoor fitness routine whilst also learning valuable boxing skills. This site will be useful for anyone with an interest in boxing as they can check what type of sessions will take place, the time it takes place and where it takes place.
